19
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.950
Wenjie, this is an official decision.

20
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.310
From this day onwards, you'll be working in the Monitoring Department.

21
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.480
Now I'll explain the work of the Monitoring Department to you.

22
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.150
Simply put, the goal is to keep an eye

23
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.430
on all enemy activities in space,

24
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.310
including intercepting communications

25
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.800
between enemy space vessels and the ground, and between the space vessels themselves,

26
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.120
track the orbits of enemy space vessels,

27
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.030
collaborate with our telemetry and tracking centers,

28
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.470
and provide data for Red Coast's combat systems.

29
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.150
In other words, the eyes of Red Coast are here.

30
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.090
Political Commissar Lei,

31
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.090
I think you should reconsider whether it's necessary to tell her this.

32
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.360
Political Commissar Lei, if it's too sensitive, then...

33
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.950
No, Wenjie.

34
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.590
Weining, like I said, work must be done.

35
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.970
She needs all the information in order to do her job.

36
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.200
Fine.

37
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.560
I'll report this to the high-ups.

38
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.730
Sure.

39
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.460
You have the right to do so.

40
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.570
But I give you my word that I'll take full responsibility for my action.

41
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.010
Alright.

42
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.030
I'll take your word for it.

43
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.190
Don't mind him.

44
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.590
That's just the way he is.

45
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.430
He can be too cautious to be openhanded at work.

46
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.000
Wenjie, come here.

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.590
Take a seat.

48
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.900
Sit.

49
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.580
Look, when we first brought you here, the goal was simple.

50
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.680
Red Coast's monitoring system often had interference

51
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.560
caused by electromagnetic radiation from solar flares and sunspots.

52
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.030
Then we came across your paper

53
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.800
and believed that you were an expert in solar activity.

54
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.470
And your predictive model was the most accurate.

55
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.360
So we wanted to solicit your help in solving this problem.

56
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.910
After you came, you demonstrated strong abilities,

57
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.470
so I decided to entrust you with more important work.

58
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.360
You've worked in Transmission for a while

59
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.480
and gained an overview of Red Coast.

60
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.430
Now that you're transferred,

61
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.870
your assignment in Monitoring will be discussed later.

62
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.480
Of course, as you can see, there's some resistance.

63
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.360
But I trust you.

64
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.830
Personally, I have faith in you.

65
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.410
I hope you can keep up the good work and earn the trust of the organization.

66
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.720
Wenjie,

67
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.440
honestly, I sincerely hope that someday,

68
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.510
I'll be able to call you Comrade Ye.

69
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.330
Don't let me down.

70
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.240
Even though Political Commissar Lei trusted me,

71
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.680
my activities were severely restricted.

72
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.040
I had access to the software source code, but not the database.

73
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.510
And I had to learn the software techniques from scratch.

74
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.960
That was far from being easy.

75
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.160
(File Bag)
(According to the latest weather forecast,)

76
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.040
(from 8:00 AM today to 8:00 PM tomorrow,)

77
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.190
(parts of the Northwest will see light snow or sleet.)

78
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.830
(The local high will be 9 degrees Celsius.)

79
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.190
Report.

80
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.700
Come in.

81
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.600
Chief Engineer Yang, after being deciphered by the computer,

82
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.360
what we had received turned out to be a few satellite photographs.

83
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.400
GSD's Surveying and Mapping Bureau said

84
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.000
they're images of our important military targets,

85
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.800
including the naval harbor at Qingdao and several key factories

86
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.270
of the Third Front program.

87
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.600
Did we monitor their satellites?

88
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.920
Analysis confirmed that these images came from the KA-9

89
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.680
Reconnaissance System of the West.

90
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.560
The first KA-9 had just been launched.

91
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.630
Although it mainly relied on recoverable film capsules for intelligence gathering,

92
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.510
it was also being used to test out

93
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.120
the more advanced radio transmission of digital images.

94
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.820
As the...

95
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.760
As the technology is undeveloped, the satellite transmitted at a low frequency,

96
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.370
which increased its range of reception sufficiently for it to be intercepted by us.

97
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.430
Abandon this target.

98
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.120
Change the frequency.

99
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.270
I'll let you know about the direction.

100
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.400
We're having a rare opportunity to learn more about the Western satellite reconnaissance system.

101
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.040
Are you sure about letting it go?

102
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.430
How many times do I have to tell you?

103
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.820
Change the direction and the frequency!

104
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.870
Transmission has a machine down.

105
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.950
Go and check it.

106
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.410
Yes, sir.

107
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.580
So, it was Yang Weining who kept holding you back?

108
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.480
He was acting weird, always lashing out at me for no reason.

109
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.310
But I didn't mind.

110
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:38.340
What mattered to me was those unexplainable matters at work.

111
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.150
They made me realize that Red Coast was

112
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.140
far more complex than I had imagined.

113
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.870
(The 299th transmission of Red Coast Project is finished.)

114
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.740
(Shutting down transmission system.)

115
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.440
(Red Coast entering monitoring mode.)

116
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.270
(Monitoring frequency range:
1,000 MHz to 40,000 MHz.)

117
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.870
(Monitoring frequency range:
1,000 MHz to 40,000 MHz.)

118
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.200
(Monitoring channels: 15,000.)

119
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.240
(Monitoring channels: 15,000.)

120
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.270
(Key frequencies to monitor:
Hydrogen atom frequency at 1,420 MHz.)

121
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:37.360
(Hydroxyl radical radiation frequency
at 1,667 MHz.)

122
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.200
(Water molecule radiation frequency
at 22,000 MHz.)

123
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.440
(Repeat.)

124
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.480
(Key frequencies to monitor:
Hydrogen atom frequency at 1,420 MHz...)

125
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.030
The designated frequencies
for the three transmissions

126
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.510
were lower than microwave range and couldn't result in

127
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.200
any heating effect in the target.

128
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.240
Both Yang Weining's strange attitude

129
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.080
and those abnormal cases said one thing.

130
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.180
That is, the real purpose of Red Coast was top-secret.

131
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.660
(Calling Wang Miao End Call)

132
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.060

133
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.410
Chang, it's me.

134
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.840
We're in Qijiatun. I've checked with the village committee.

135
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.150
(Red Coast File Bag)

136
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.240
That red ginseng factory checks out.

137
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.440
The locals can get paid by working there.

138
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.910
Where are we on declassifying the files?

139
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.360
You've promised me. I need them today.

140
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360
I've got them.

141
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.430
What's inside is way beyond imagination.

142
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.510
Don't keep me guessing, OK?

143
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.190
What on earth is Red Coast for?

144
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.570
Their research is indeed the most confidential.

145
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.550
(Troubleshooting of Magnetic Core Memory is complete.)

146
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.840
(Clear fault codes.)

147
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.240
Hello?

148
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.590
Ye Wenjie, come to my office now.

149
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.700
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.910
(A routine work meeting will be held at 3:00 PM.)

151
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.270
(Please be prepared.)

152
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:39.060
(Department heads are to attend on time.)

153
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.160
Report.

154
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.650
Come in.

155
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.110
Ye Wenjie, come here.

156
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.930
I assumed Political Commissar Lei

157
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.840
was being punished for promoting me.

158
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.120
I told myself that no matter what,

159
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.100
I couldn't drag him down even if I had to lie.

160
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.640
(Ye Wenjie Experience)

161
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:02.950
Ye Wenjie, first, let me be clear that I disagree with all this.

162
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.900
The decision was made by Chief Engineer Yang after seeking the high-ups' permission.

163
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.420
He alone will take all the consequences.

164
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.510
To better utilize your skills, he talked to the superiors repeatedly.

165
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:23.030
Army Political Department did their investigation, too.

166
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.910
Now, we've been authorized to disclose the true nature of the Red Coast Project to you.

167
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.480
I hope you'll treasure this opportunity and work hard to redeem your sins.

168
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.570
From now on, you must behave with the utmost propriety.

169
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.530
Any transgression

170
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.380
will receive the harshest punishment.

171
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.480
Understood?

172
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.320
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.960
It wasn't until then that I realized

174
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.480
everything Lei Zhicheng had told me was a lie.

175
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.720
Red Coast was neither a powerful weapon

176
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.000
nor a monitor on enemy space vessels.

177
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.890
All his care, promotion, and protection were all an act.

178
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.410
That's why Yang Weining tried to stop him.

179
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.980
Yang Weining was a good man.

180
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.860
When the leaders doubted me for my background,

181
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.220
he stood up for me.

182
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.240
And it was also he

183
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:59.390
who told me the truth about Red Coast.

184
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.030
If you want to quit, it's not too late now.

185
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.860
I'll do it.

186
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Are you sure?

187
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.620
Once you said yes, the last ray of hope of leaving Radar Peak would be gone.

188
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:30.480
You'd spend the rest of your life here.

189
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.450
Yes, I'll do it.

190
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:57.520
The truth was an incredible fairy tale for the ages.

191
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.000
It's a lot.

192
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.940
Read it yourself.

193
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:44.580
(A Question Largely Ignored by Trends in Fundamental World Scientific Research)

194
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.820
(Space Science and Technology)

195
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.960
This file talks about two ways to convert the results

196
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.160
of fundamental scientific research into practical applications:

197
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.480
gradualistic mode and saltatory mode.

198
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.750
That's right.

199
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.510
Gradualistic mode refers to theoretical, fundamental results

200
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.400
being gradually applied to technology

201
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.960
such as the development and application of space technology.

202
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.160
Saltatory mode means theoretical, fundamental results

203
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.830
rapidly become applied technology,

204
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.680
(Nuclear Weapons)
leading to a technological leap.

205
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.920
Examples include nuclear weapons.

206
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.140
Yes.

207
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.110
Now, both NATO and the Warsaw Pact

208
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.100
are intensely active in fundamental research and investing heavily in it.

209
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.920
At this rate, technological leaps may occur anytime.

210
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.680
That will pose a major threat to our strategic planning.

211
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.030
Here it lists the fields where such leaps are most likely:

212
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:04.220
physics, biology, computer science.

213
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.740
(SETI)

214
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.890
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

215
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.830
If a leap occurs in this field,

216
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:34.790
its impact will exceed the sum of that in the other three.

217
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.790
That's what I'm talking about.

218
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:43.410
Several NATO states have already prioritized SETI.

219
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.350
For example, they launched Project Ozma

220
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.950
(Green Bank Telescope at NRAO)
and built NRAO.

221
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.930
(Concise Star Chart)
The project examined the stars

222
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.660
Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani

223
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.850
and planned to broaden the frequency range in 1972.

224
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.510
The Pioneer 10 and 11 probes would be launched,

225
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.250
each carrying a metal plaque with information about civilization on Earth.

226
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:13.500
And in 1977, they'd launch the Voyager 1 and 2 probes, each with a metal audio record.

227
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.510
This is the Arecibo Observatory.

228
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.350
It's ready to use and extremely powerful.

229
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.680
Its effective energy collection area is about 20 acres,

230
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.960
greater than that of all the others in the world combined.

231
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.830
Together with the computer system,

232
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.270
it can simultaneously monitor 65,000 channels,

233
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.720
and it's capable of ultrahigh energy transmissions.

234
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.510
Look.

235
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.440
This is in Europe.

236
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.450
They've also made huge investments.

237
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.720
The entire world is working on SETI.

238
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.330
That's true.

239
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.210
Except for us who are paying little attention to it.

240
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:02.350
You should know, if any country gets in touch with extraterrestrials,

241
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.440
it'll overturn the global landscape, especially those superpowers.

242
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.250
If they beat us to it, we'll no longer have a chance.

243
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.880
As a major socialist power, we cannot fall behind.

244
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.550
This unknown area must be conquered for strategic importance.

245
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.060
There's a long way ahead of us.

246
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.110
Ye Wenjie, from this moment on,

247
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.440
your job is to develop the Red Coast Self-Interpreting Code System.

248
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.240
Precisely, using universal, basic mathematical,

249
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.310
and physical laws to construct an elemental linguistic code

250
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:47.110
that can be understood by any civilization that has mastered basic algebra,

251
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.160
Euclidean geometry, and the laws of nonrelativistic physics.

252
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.440
Building on that, create a brand-new linguistic system

253
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.900
including Chinese and Esperanto.

254
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.280
Do you get it?

255
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.190
Yes, sir.

256
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.830
So, the mysterious Red Coast Project was established for SETI,

257
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.660
and you alone

258
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.370
created the Red Coast Self-Interpreting Code System.

259
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.460
At that time, the Cold War was at its height.

260
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:31.540
The insanity of the human race had reached its historical zenith.

261
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:37.130
Nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons lurking in the corners

262
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.540
could be launched at a moment's notice.

263
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.580
Once they were let go, hundreds of cities would be leveled,

264
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.560
killing hundreds of millions of people.

265
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.980
With such technical leaps in sight,

266
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:56.480
an intense sense of crisis was shared all over the world.

267
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.720
Professor Ye, you're an astrophysicist.

268
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.070
Do you really think astronomy will be taking a technological leap?

269
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.090
As destructive as nukes are,

270
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.400
the universe is harboring even more terrible forces

271
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.300
such as black holes and anti-matter.

272
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.220
Compared with them,

273
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.250
a nuclear bomb is nothing but a tiny candle.

274
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:34.540
There used to be a waveform monitor.

275
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:40.080
It was to display the waves that Red Coast picked up from space.

276
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:47.020
My daily work was to monitor and record that curve,

277
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.710
waiting to hear from the extraterrestrials.

278
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.080
Over there,

279
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.860
we had a radio receiver,

280
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.520
quite sophisticated.

281
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.020
A ruby-based traveling-wave maser amplified

282
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.530
the signals received by the gigantic antenna.

283
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.780
But there was interference.

284
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.920
Wouldn't it affect the accuracy?

285
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:33.430
Wang, you're underestimating Red Coast.

286
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:40.210
As immature as the technology was,

287
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:44.410
it could do more than you think.

288
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.740
The core of the reception system

289
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.740
was immersed in liquid helium at -269 degrees Celsius.

290
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:58.130
A helicopter came to resupply liquid helium regularly.

291
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.980
The reception system was thus

292
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.990
capable of picking up faint signals.

293
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:14.200
Back then, our monitoring range was within a radius of 1,000 light years,

294
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.510
containing some 20 million stars.

295
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:22.930
Other than searching for and monitoring possible extraterrestrial intelligence,

296
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.850
we also tried to

297
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.310
send messages to the universe 
 <i>[20 Million Stars]</i>

298
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:33.170
to establish contact and communication.

299
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:39.730
So did you really make such attempts?

300
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.390
We did.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.410
<i>and everyone's material and spiritual needs are fully met</i>

325
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.790
<i>so that civilization on Earth may become more perfect.</i>

326
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.440
<i>With the best of intentions, we look forward to establishing contact</i>

327
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.950
<i>with other civilized societies in the universe.</i>

328
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.370
<i>We look forward to working with you</i>

329
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:06.190
<i>to build a better life in this vast universe."</i>

330
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:12.600
This letter of humans' best wishes was sent to the universe.

331
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:18.400
Enclosed was an overview of Earth,

332
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.410
life on Earth,

333
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:27.170
and human society as well as basic world history.

334
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:32.380
All that was sent after transmitting the Self-interpreting Code System.

335
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.330
Red Coast is a great project, no doubt.

336
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.980
When sending messages to the universe,

337
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.960
how did you ensure our security?

338
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:54.400
It was carefully vetted to ensure that it didn't give away

339
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.820
the Earth's coordinates relative to the Milky Way.

340
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:06.450
At the 2,280 MHz, 12,000 MHz, and 22,000 MHz channels,

341
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.260
the transmission times of the message were

342
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:16.540
31 minutes, 7.5 minutes, and 3.5 minutes respectively.

343
00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.870
Transmission at the higher-frequency 12,000 MHz and 22,000 MHz channels

344
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:27.860
was minimized in case our location was exposed.

345
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.180
Back in those days,

346
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:38.320
SETI at Red Coast was marginalized research.

347
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.750
But why such a high security rating?

348
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.820
They asked the same question at the very beginning of the Project

349
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:54.010
and it was asked until the very end.

350
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.440
But now, you should have the answer.

351
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:08.010
We can only marvel at the foresight of the top decision-maker of the Project.

352
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.690
Had Red Coast succeeded,

353
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.740
the world would be utterly different.

354
00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:24.980
Well, it's still too soon to tell whether it succeeded or not.

355
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:32.570
The radio waves sent out haven't gone too far in the universe yet.

356
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.210
The farther the signals travel, the weaker they become,

357
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:43.690
and the less likely that any extraterrestrial civilization will receive them.

358
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:50.990
In order for extraterrestrials to detect our signals,

359
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:56.890
we broadcast at a power level equal to the energy output of a mid-sized star.

360
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.200
Soviet astrophysicist Nicolai Kardashev once proposed

361
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.100
that we could divide civilizations

362
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.930
based on the power they could command for communication purposes,

363
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.890
He divided them into three types:

364
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:17.040
A Type I civilization can muster an amount of energy equal to the total output of the Earth.

365
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:23.000
A Type II civilization can marshal the energy equal to the output of a typical star.

366
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:29.500
A Type III civilization can utilize its communication energy equal to the energy output of a galaxy.

367
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:35.580
Civilization on Earth is currently not even a full Type I.

368
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.310
And the transmissions from Red Coast used only about one ten-thousandth

369
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.230
of the power the Earth could muster.

370
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.710
Our call wasn't any louder

371
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:52.310
than the buzzing of a mosquito.

372
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.780
No one could hear it.

373
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.740
But the Type II and III civilizations Kardashev proposed do exist,

374
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.800
we should be able to hear them by now.

375
00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:08.400
In this case, our efforts seem to have only proven one thing

376
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.920
that in the vast universe, only the Earth has intelligent life.

377
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:24.580
Theoretically, there might never be a definitive answer to that question.

378
00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.640
But emotionally,

379
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:33.550
I and everyone else who went through Red Coast

380
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.080
all believed so.

381
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.960
Too bad the Project was decommissioned.

382
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.600
It was there already and should've kept going.

383
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.410
It was a great cause worth fighting for.

384
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.280
In the late 70s,

385
00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.840
there was a large-scale renovation.

386
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.350
The transmission system was automated.

387
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.510
Data processing of monitoring became far more advanced.

388
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.550
40,000 channels could be monitored simultaneously.

389
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:38.930
The more people knew, the clearer they became about the difficulty of SETI.

390
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:44.650
And the leadership lost interest in Red Coast.

391
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.650
After the renovation,

392
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:53.680
the first change we experienced was lowered security rating.

393
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.750
The security detail was reduced to a group of five guards.

394
00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.580
Salute!

395
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.830
Red Coast remained within the Second Artillery Corps,

396
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:11.290
but management of its scientific activities was turned over to the Astronomy Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

397
00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:17.960
and it took on some research projects that had nothing to do with SETI.

398
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.830
I believe you achieved most of your accomplishments then.

399
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:33.070
At the time, we had China's largest radio telescope.

400
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:38.650
Following all those changes, we first took on some radio astronomy projects.

401
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.640
Later, more and more such observatories were built,

402
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.680
and Red Coast shifted to the observation and

403
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.820
analysis of solar electromagnetic activity

404
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.350
with an added solar telescope.

405
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.820
I bet practical applications were a ton.

406
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.270
Correct.

407
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:04.640
The mathematical model we built for solar electromagnetic activity

408
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.670
was state-of-the-art.

409
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.550
With such fruition, the large investment in Red Coast

410
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.670
saw a little bit of return.

411
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:22.110
Actually, much of the credit should go to Political Commissar Lei,

412
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.480
although he did have his own agenda, too.

413
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.330
Political Commissar Lei?

414
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:33.360
Wasn't he a political officer in that technical unit?

415
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.810
Before enlisting, he had studied astrophysics as well.

416
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:45.980
Research projects we took on outside of SETI were all due to his efforts.

417
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.590
It wasn't easy to return to technical work.

418
00:34:54.590 --> 00:35:00.310
Without Lei, Red Coast would've been long gone.

419
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.790
When it was converted for civil use,

420
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.840
the military basically abandoned it.

421
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.150
Chinese Academy of Sciences could no longer keep the base running.

422
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:19.630
Inevitably, it was shut down.

423
00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:05.130
In the dead of the night, when I was alone

424
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.610
in the empty monitoring room,

425
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:14.730
I could hear in my headphones the lifeless noise of the universe.

426
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:19.800
It was faint but continuous,

427
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.840
more eternal than the stars.

428
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:29.420
Sometimes I thought it sounded like

429
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.260
the endless cold winds of Radar Peak.

430
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.330
I was chilled to the bone.

431
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.410
There weren't enough words

432
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.460
to describe such loneliness.

433
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:55.630
SETI is quite a unique discipline.

434
00:36:55.630 --> 00:37:02.230
It can shape researchers' perspectives on life.

435
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:12.620
It occurred to me repeatedly that life was truly an accident among all the accidents in the universe.

436
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:19.100
And the universe was an empty palace

437
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:27.690
in which humankind was the only ant.

438
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:59.490
This kind of thinking made me live a conflicted life since.

439
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:05.550
Sometimes I thought life was precious

440
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.250
and more important than anything.

441
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.130
But other times,

442
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:19.860
I found humans so insignificant that nothing was worthwhile.

443
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:25.030
Anyway, despite such internal conflicts,

444
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.480
my life slipped away,

445
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:33.370
and before I knew it, I was already old.

446
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:48.510
I'm not getting any younger or healthier.

447
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.320
I can't predict the future.

448
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.600
All I can do is live my life as it is.

449
