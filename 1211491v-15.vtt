(Presently, according to the Ticket Center of the BOCOG,)

11
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.300

(applying for purchasing over 4.9 million opening ceremony tickets.)

13
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.250
You were reading this book last night. Now you're reading it again.

14
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.640
Is it relevant to your research?

15
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.920
Some problems have to be solved sooner or later.

16
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.430
Doudou, wash your hands and have breakfast.

17
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.140
OK.

18
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400
Dad, I have a question for you.

19
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.750
There's a 700-meter-long road with a lamp every 10 meters.

20
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.190
There will be wastage as long as the lamps are on.

21
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.030
15 lamps will be busted every hour.

22
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.870
An electrician comes once an hour to repair three lamps.

23
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.080
Do you know how many lamps are busted from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM?

24
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.800
They are all busted.

25
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.530
Wrong.

26
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.000
Why is it wrong?

27
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.470
If 12 lamps are busted in one hour, they will all be busted in six hours.

28
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.840
How many hours are there from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM?

29
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

30
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.240
Eight hours.

31
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.470
So, they are all broken.

32
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.090
No, no.

33
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.870
Then you tell me how many of them are broken?

34
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.800
It's daytime from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

35
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.510
No lamp is on. Dad, you're silly.

36
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.190
You tricked me.

37
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.840
I didn't.

38
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.360
I got you.

39
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.030
Of course you tricked me.

40
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.020
Dad thought it was a serious math problem, not expecting it to be a brain teaser.

41
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.950
I told you the answer, but you didn't realize.

42
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.430
Dad, what's wrong?

43
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.430
Doudou, you are right.

44
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.120
In the seemingly complex problem,

45
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.930
all the important information is hidden there.

46
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.290
Dad is really silly.

47
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.750
Dad should have thought of something early.

48
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.940
What's the thing?

49
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.630
Doudou, do you know Copernicus?

50
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.430
Yes.

51
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.820
He was a scientist who proposed Heliocentrism.

52
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.960
Copernicus was the man who reminded people of the daytime

53
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.280
when they were busy calculating how many lamps there were broken.

54
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.520
That's what I was doing! I'm Copernicus!

55
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.750
Dad should learn from you

56
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.950
and be another Copernicus.

57
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.940
(Hairen)

58
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.500
(Copernicus)

59
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.680
You're late.

60
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.430
The meeting has been going on for a while.

61
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.950
I'm Pope Gregory.

62
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.270
Pope Gregory?

63
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.720
So it's the Middle Ages in Europe?

64
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.110
In the world of Three-Body, historical references are anachronistic.

65
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.160
Dear Copernicus, you changed your ID, but we all recognize you.

66
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.480
In the previous civilizations, you traveled to the East.

67
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.070
I'm Aristotle.

68
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.260
This is Galileo.

69
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.860
I understand the world through observation and experiment.

70
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.830
Mozi also conducted experiments and observation.

71
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.190
Mozi, Mozi.

72
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.950
He was only a mystic dressed as a scientist.

73
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.220
Mozi advanced Civilization No. 141 into the Eastern Han period with his machine.

74
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.930
So what?

75
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.870
We're different from him.

76
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.830
Based on large amounts of observation and experiments,

77
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.870
we make strict, logical deductions to build a model of the universe.

78
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.510
Then we go back to experimentation and observation to test it.

79
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.770
Dear Galileo, that's also my way of thinking.

80
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.830
In that case, show me your calendar.

81
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.850
Pope, I don't have a calendar.

82
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.950
I only have a model of the universe built upon observation data.

83
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.510
But I must make it clear that even if the model is correct,

84
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.830
it may not precisely predict the sun's motion and create a calendar.

85
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.310
However, in any case, it's a necessary step.

86
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.870
Go ahead.

87
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.480
It's pretty simple.

88
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.360
The reason why the sun's motion seems patternless

89
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.070
is because our world has three suns.

90
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.950
Under interaction, their movements are unpredictable. It's the three-body problem.

91
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.000
When our planet revolves around one of the suns

92
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.120
in a stable orbit, that's a Stable Era.

93
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.870
When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance,

94
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.000
their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it's orbiting,

95
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.270
causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns.

96
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.480
That's a Chaotic Era.

97
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.720
After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again

98
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.830
pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins.

99
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.920
This is like a football game.

100
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.720
The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.

101
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.650
Burn him to death.

102
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.120
At least let me finish!

103
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.870
Have you seen three suns?

104
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.270
Or do you know anyone who has?

105
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.440
Everyone has seen them.

106
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.270
The sun that we see at different times may not be the same.

107
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.080
It's only one of the three suns.

108
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.080
And the other two are the flying stars.

109
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.550
Flying stars?

110
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.000
Flying stars are stars with unstable cycles of revolution and rotation.

111
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.420
When the sun is far enough, it looks like a flying star.

112
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.200
You lack basic scientific training.

113
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.030
The sun must move continuously to a distant spot.

114
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.000
It cannot jump over the intervening space.

115
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.240
According to your hypothesis, there should be another situation.

116
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.490
The sun gets smaller than it usually appears but bigger than a flying star,

117
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.360
and gradually shrinks into a flying star as it moves farther away.

118
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.600
But we've never seen the sun behave that way.

119
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.750
Galileo, if you have scientific training,

120
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.670
you ought to have some knowledge of the sun's structure.

121
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.360
The sun is made of a sparse but expansive gaseous outer layer

122
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.550
and a dense and hot inner core!

123
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.390
Very true.

124
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.390
But Galileo, you apparently haven't discovered

125
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.670
the special optical interaction between the sun's gaseous outer layer

126
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.080
and our planet's atmosphere.

127
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.150
Go on.

128
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.390
It's a phenomenon akin to polarization.

129
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.840
When the sun gets a certain distance from us

130
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.720
and we view it from within our atmosphere,

131
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.960
the gaseous outer layer becomes transparent and invisible.

132
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.120
The sun we see is its bright inner core.

133
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.080
But we mistake it for a flying star.

134
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.270
This phenomenon has confused every researcher throughout history.

135
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.030
But now we understand why the appearance of three flying stars

136
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.480
heralds a long period of extreme cold.

137
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.550
Because at that time, all three suns are far, far, far, far away.

138
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.030
But based on your theory,

139
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:43.510
we should also sometimes see three normal-sized suns.

140
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.600
This has never happened.

141
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.870
In all the records of all the civilizations, this has never occurred!

142
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.910
Wait!

143
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.360
There may be such historical records.

144
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.030
One civilization saw two suns and was immediately destroyed

145
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:10.600
by their combined heat, but the record was very vague.

146
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.960
I'm Leonardo da Vinci.

147
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.390
He was talking about three suns, not two, you fool!

148
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.720
Don't touch me.

149
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.870
Pope, according to his theory, three suns must appear sometime,

150
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.910
just like three flying stars.

151
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.340
Three suns have appeared.

152
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.390
And many people have seen them.

153
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.960
But any information about them couldn't be recorded.

154
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.390
Because those who saw such a great sight

155
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.580
had at most a few seconds left to live.

156
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.750
They had no chance to escape or survive.

157
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.520
Tri-solar days are the most terrifying catastrophes for the world.

158
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.650
On such days, the surface of the planet

159
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.240
would turn into a smelting furnace in a second,

160
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.060
and the heat would melt all rocks.

161
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.080
After the destruction caused by a tri-solar day,

162
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.270
an eon would pass before the reappearance of life and civilization.

163
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.100
This is why there's no historical record.

164
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.820
Burn him.

165
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.550
Who is this person?

166
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.820
Giordano Bruno.

167
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.390
He believed that the universe has no center.

168
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.670
The earth is just a planet orbiting the sun

169
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:35.040
and the sun is only one of countless stars in the universe.

170
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.030
So you believe that he's wrong?

171
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.250
Do you really think you're right?

172
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.270
Use a low fire.

173
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.490
What are you doing?

174
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.130
Let go!

175
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.070
Let go of me!

176
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.820
What are you doing?

177
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.150
Pope, you are only a program!

178
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.060
As for the rest of you, you're either programs or idiots.

179
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.420
You just can't accept things beyond your cognition!

180
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.770
You can't accept them even in a game!

181
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.120
I will log back on!

182
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.840
You cannot return.

183
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.960
You will disappear forever from the world of Three-Body.

184
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.840
I'll switch computers and create a new ID.

185
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.940
I'll announce myself when I'm back.

186
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.560
It won't work.

187
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.580
The system has recorded your retinal scan through the V-suit.

188
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.200
Let me go!

189
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.360
I'm telling the truth!

190
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.510
Let go!

191
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.030
If you're telling the truth, you won't be burnt to death.

192
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.750
The game rewards those who are on the right path.

193
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.490
What are you doing?

194
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.200
You can't do this!

195
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.090
The world has ended! The world has ended!

196
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.820
Dehydrate! Dehydrate!

197
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.150
Everyone, go to the dehydratories!

198
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.090
Get ready to dehydrate!

199
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.670
<i>Civilization No. 183 was destroyed by a tri-solar day.</i>

200
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.370
<i>This civilization had advanced to the Middle Ages.</i>

201
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.000
<i>After a long time, life and civilization will begin again,</i>

202
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.380
<i>and progress once more through the unpredictable world of Three-Body.</i>

203
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.150
<i>But in this civilization,</i>

204
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.820
<i>Copernicus successfully revealed the basic structure of the universe.</i>

205
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.700
<i>The civilization of Three-Body will take its first leap.</i>

206
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.720
<i>The game has now entered the second level.</i>

207
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.220
<i>We invite you to log on to the second level of Three-Body.</i>

208
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.130
The second level?

209
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.990
How did you make it?

210
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.820
I revealed the basic structure of the universe in the game.

211
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.620
What basic... what of the universe?

212
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.890
It's like he found out that the earth is
round and told people about gravitation.

213
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.030
Then what did you find out?

214
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.820
What is the name of this game?

215
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.910
Three-Body.

216
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.170
Yeah. The answer is in the name.

217
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.610
We've been distracted by complicated semblances before,

218
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.670
and have neglected the most important information.

219
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.080
The name? How can we get the answer from the name?

220
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.050
In the world of Three-Body,

221
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.460
there are three suns.

222
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.560
A sun is a flying star.

223
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.390
When it's close enough to us, it looks like the sun.

224
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:15.120
When it's far enough from us, it looks like a flying star.

225
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.460
The sun that we see at different times may not be the same.

226
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.910
It's only one of the three suns.

227
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.600
I know a bit about this.

228
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.150
All the stars are the suns.

229
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.490
Fixed stars.

230
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.870
They are stars when they are far away, right?

231
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.200
Shen Yufei wanted you to know the world of the farmer.

232
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.910
Then farmer lives in a world where the stars are close...

233
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.460
Where the three suns...

234
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.550
Where the three stars become suns...

235
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.440
I don't think so.

236
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.340
The civilizations of Three-Body were destroyed again and again.

237
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.240
How could it achieve a scientific and technological level

238
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.440
that exceeds the cognition of humans?

239
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.580
Indeed.

240
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.360
It will be impressive if they've developed in such an environment.

241
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.500
- You're right. 
 - What is right?

242
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.370
You should clear the game at one fling.

243
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.160
What are you guys doing? Why haven't you cleared the game?

244
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.180
Flying stars are the breakthrough

245
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.920
for Wang Miao to reveal the structure of the universe in the game.

246
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.690
He only obtained the information after being prompted by Ye Wenjie

247
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.980
and reading the paper and the book.

248
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.210
Now I have to believe that Ye Wenjie is very suspicious.

249
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.500
Didn't you believe that before?

250
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.370
No. Our previous inference lacked effective support.

251
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.310
The textbook cliché.

252
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.070
Do you think all evidence will be presented under your nose?

253
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.020
Use your imagination.

254
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.060
Don't scientists always say to assume boldly and demonstrate carefully?

255
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.310
See?

256
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.650
It's time for demonstration.

257
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.730
Don't you like stewed assorted giblets?

258
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.730
None of the ten of us likes it.

259
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.000
I only bought one order.

260
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.180
It's nothing compared to the appetite of ten people. Have some.

261
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.750
You keep talking about treating me to a big meal.

262
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.520
Seriously?

263
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.640
Don't be picky.

264
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.590
Isn't it a big meal?

265
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.070
Wait, wait. What about the thing I asked you to do?

266
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.170
Ye Wenjie.

267
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.370
Declassify her files.

268
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.510
Is it done?

269
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.850
Almost. Almost.

270
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.740
Can you stop asking?

271
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.030
Is it so difficult?

272
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.980
I've told you many times that Ye Wenjie is very important.

273
00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.900
You've told me your assumptions many, many times.

274
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.140
Tell him once more.

275
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.650
Wang Miao got to the second level in the game.

276
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.530
The reason why he made it is because he revealed the basic structure of the universe.

277
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:55.590
His finding benefited from a paper many years ago written by Ye Wenjie.

278
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.060
Chang, you must help me to declassify the files.

279
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.000
Can I eat now?

280
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.690
Help yourself.

281
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.710
You haven't changed at all.

282
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.640
Everyone, thanks for attending today's event.

283
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.860
See you next time.

284
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.620
<i>[Frontiers of Science]</i>

285
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.550
As far as I know, the theory of the shooter and the farmer

286
00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.260
isn't new in the scientific circle.

287
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.610
Yes.

288
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.020
We have discussed this question countless times.

289
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.850
So is such introduction some kind of a ritual?

290
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.370
Take it as a ritual for the unlimited exploration of the Frontiers of Science.

291
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.410
Don't you think it's religious?

292
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.340
It's against science.

293
00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.400
You are very sharp and observant, but it has nothing to do with religion.

294
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.870
So mankind is really like two-dimensional creatures?

295
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.350
The scientific worldview is to remain skeptical,

296
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.070
just as you media workers do.

297
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:19.040
But in fact, I don't think you are very interested in science itself.

298
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.500
You're right.

299
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.160
I'm more interested in people's views on such things.

300
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.540
What's the purpose of the Frontiers of Science?

301
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.650
About that, you can ask Pan Han.

302
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.710
I think that Mr. Pan hasn't attended your events for a long time.

303
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.740
You seem to not know him that well.

304
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.340
He'll tell you if you ask him.

305
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.970
Though we have different views and act differently,

306
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.890
the Frontiers of Science is open.

307
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.450
You are welcome to visit anytime.

308
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.000
You have different views? How come?

309
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.480
You ask too many questions.

310
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.330
Before this question, you need to find the answer of the previous one.

311
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.270
Wang Miao.

312
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.720
Wang Miao.

313
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.840
What are you thinking about?

314
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.100
Are you dreaming away?

315
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.990
You should spend more time with your daughter.

316
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.500
Doudou.

317
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.120
Doudou. Come.

318
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.850
Have some water.

319
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Be careful.

320
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.600
Shameless!

321
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600
Wretch!

322
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.000
He dared to claim that
he invented calculus!

323
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.200
Isaac Newton.

324
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.000
Then the one who ran away
must be Leibniz?

325
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Indeed.

326
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.600
I don't really care about
this little claim to fame.

327
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.400
Inventing the three laws of mechanics
has already made me the greatest,

328
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.200
God excepted.

329
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200
Yes.

330
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.400
That's really great.

331
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.200
From planetary motion to cell division,

332
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.400
everything follows the three great laws.

333
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.200
Now, with calculus,
the powerful mathematical tool,

334
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.200
it will only be a matter of time
before we master the pattern

335
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.600
of the motion of the three suns.

336
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.200
It's not that simple.

337
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200
Have you considered
the amount of calculation?

338
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.200
I saw the differential equations
you listed,

339
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.200
and I don't think an analytical solution
is possible,

340
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.300
only a numerical one.

341
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.700
It requires such
calculating capacity that

342
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.800
even if the world's mathematicians
worked nonstop,

343
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.400
they couldn't complete them
at the end of the world.

344
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.100
Of course,
if we can't figure out the pattern

345
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.620
of the suns' movements soon,

346
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.700
the end of the world won't be far away.

347
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.400
Von Neumann.

348
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.300
Indeed.

349
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.400
You're the only one
who can solve the problem.

350
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.200
Exactly.

351
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.600
Didn't you bring us
thousands of miles to the East

352
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.600
to solve the problem
of calculating these equations?

353
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.400
Leibniz, the degenerate,
also came with us.

354
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.500
But I don't understand.

355
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.400
Why you had to come to the East
to build a computer?

356
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.800
A computer?

357
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.600
A computing machine?

358
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.800
Does such a thing exist?

359
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.800
You don't know about computers?

360
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.100
You're the father of computer!

361
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.200
Right, it's reasonable in the game.

362
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200
Then, what do you intend to use to

363
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200
complete the vast amount
of calculations?

364
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.600
Use what?

365
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.500
Use people, of course.

366
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.800
Other than people, what else in the world
is capable of performing calculations?

367
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.800
No, no, you just said that

368
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.100
all the mathematicians in the world wouldn't be enough.

369
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.200
Instead of mathematicians,
we'll use common people.

370
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.400
Common laborers, but in a large number,

371
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.800
at least 30 million.

372
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.400
We'll do mathematics
using human wave tactics.

373
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.300
Or we didn't have to come to the East.

374
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.800
Common laborers?

375
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.100
30 million?

376
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.800
You mean 30 million people
who understand calculus?

377
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.800
Have you heard the joke about
the Army of Sichuan?

378
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.000
Some soldiers were being drilled,
but without education,

379
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.600
they couldn't follow the orders
to march LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT.

380
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.200
So the instructor
came up with a solution.

381
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.400
He had every soldier wear
a straw shoe on the left foot

382
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.400
and a cloth shoe on the right.

383
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.400
When they marched, he shouted,

384
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.200
STRAW-CLOTH-STRAW-CLOTH, STRAW-CLOTH...

385
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.700
I never thought that you knew
so much about the East

386
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.700
and could speak so many dialects.

387
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.500
It doesn't matter.

388
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.000
The point is that's the kind
of soldier we need.

389
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.200
Except we need 30 million of them.

390
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.800
But where can we find such a large army?

391
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:31.200
So we need
Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor.

392
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.600
Qin Shi Huang?

393
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.500
He's now in charge here?

394
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:42.300
♪Rock in the sky♪

395
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.500

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.600
Kowtow.

398
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.400
If you want me to gather
30 million men for you

399
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.500
to use the three laws of motion
and calculus

400
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.700
to forecast the movements of the suns,

401
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.400
you must at least demonstrate

402
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.300
how such calculations
would be conducted.

403
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.800
Your Majesty,
please give me three soldiers.

404
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.300
I will demonstrate.

405
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.800
Three?

406
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.500
Your Imperial Majesty,

407
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.800
the complicated objects of the universe

408
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.000
are made from the simplest elements.

409
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I only need three.

410
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.400
To the court!

411
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.300
The two of you will be
responsible for signal input.

412
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.800
I'll call you "Input 1" and "Input 2".

413
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.200
You'll be responsible for signal output,
and you're "Output".

414
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.500
Like this. Form a triangle.

415
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.200
Output is the apex.

416
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.400
Input 1 and Input 2 form the base.

417
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.800
Stand in the Wedge Attack Formation.

418
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.400
You should command soldiers
with professional orders.

419
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.900
Your Majesty, you're wise.

420
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.000
Here.

421
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.400
Red represents 0; white represents 1.

422
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.000
Good. Now, listen to me.

423
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.400
Output, you turn around and look at
Input 1 and Input 2.

424
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.600
If they both raise white lanterns,
you raise the white lantern as well.

425
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.000
Under other circumstances,
you raise the red lantern.

426
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.700
There are three such circumstances,
Input 1, red; Input 2, white.

427
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.400
Both red.

428
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.900
Input 1, white; Input 2, red.

429
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.500
Are you clear?

430
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.000
I think you should use some other color.

431
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.200
White means bad luck.

432
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.400
But they stand out.

433
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.300
Let's try.

434
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.000
Input 1, raise the white lantern.

435
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.200
♪Roc in the sky♪

441
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Your Majesty,
your army is truly matchless.

442
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.200
In such a short time,
we have completed such complex training.

443
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.600
Now I can understand
why Von Neumann said that

444
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.300
with only two or three soldiers,

445
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.600
he could build a gate component
of a computing system.

446
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.200
It's very simple.

447
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.600
Any common soldier
can master the skills after training.

448
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.000
Don't they need to learn more?

449
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.400
No.

450
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.500
The soldiers form AND gates, NOT gates,

451
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.500
NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, XNOR gates,

452
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.200
tristate gates and ten million of these gates,

453
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.800
then put the components
together into a system.

454
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.700
This system will then be able to carry out
the calculations we need

455
00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.500
and work out those differential equations
for predicting the suns' movements.

456
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.100
We could call the system...

457
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.200
Um...

458
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.800
What?

459
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.800
A computer, Your Majesty.

460
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.800
Good.

461
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.200
Computer, that's a great name.

462
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.200
The entire system is a large machine,

463
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.200
the most complex one in history.

464
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:30.400
Even in a Chaotic Era,
my army continues to train.

465
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.600
Your Majesty, you're wise.

466
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.200
Ye Wenjie.

467
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.200
(Astrophysicist)
There's something in Ye Wenjie's social relations

468
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.500
that we haven't noticed before.

469
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.800
She has a niece called Chen Xue.

470
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.600
Niece?

471
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.800
Then,
she is Ye Wenxue's daughter, right?

472
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.400
Yeah.

473
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.400
But Ye Wenxue
parted from her very early.

474
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.800
(Mother and daughter)
Since college,

475
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.900
she has been supported by Ye Wenjie.

476
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.700
I thought the sisters hated each other.

477
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.400
Why would she do that?

478
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.100
Where is Chen Xue?

479
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.100
Why didn't we find that before?

480
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.200
She has been studying at MIT.

481
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.200
(Chen Xue, graduated from MIT)
She graduated this June.

482
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.200
Where was she when Yang Dong
committed suicide?

483
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.600
Conducting a survey in South America
with an MIT research team.

484
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.900
Is she back now?

485
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.400
She returned a few days ago.

486
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.800
Then she's been living
above Ye Wenjie's apartment.

487
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.400
I hear that it belongs to
one of Ye Wenjie's colleagues

488
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.200
and Ye borrowed it.

489
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.600
But Chen Xue

490
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.400
(Chen Xue)
often goes abroad with the research team

491
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.400
and is hardly at home.

492
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.000
I checked up on her simply
and found nothing suspicious.

493
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.100
Around the time of Yang Dong's suicide,
she was abroad

494
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.000
focusing on academic research,

495
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.800
(Investigation Report Chen Xue)
and didn't contact the Frontiers of Science, or Shen Yufei.

496
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.600
She didn't even contact Ye Wenjie much.

497
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.800
Anything else?

498
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.500
One more thing.

499
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.100
Shen Yufei

500
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.700
(Shen Yufei)
owns a company producing nanomaterial products.

501
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.400
But a few months ago,

502
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.000
she hired many calculators
working in mathematics.

503
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.800
Do they need to understand math
to work in nanomaterials?

504
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.600
You need to understand math
no matter what you do.

505
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.600
But she suddenly hired
so many calculators.

506
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.000
Apparently, it has nothing to do
with her main business.

507
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.800
I also found that
the salesmen in her company

508
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.700
had no contact with the calculators.

509
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:34.000
Shen Yufei may be using them
to do something else.

510
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.500
Math.

511
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.600
Math.

512
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.200
Math.

513
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.600
Fundamental physics. Astrophysics.

514
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600
Applied physics.

515
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.500
Now there is math.

516
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.200
Learning is really an endless process.

517
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.820
(Physicist)

518
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.900
(Couple Shen Yufei Math Wei Cheng)

519
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.200
What does that mean?

520
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:21.800
Do those mathematicians
have anything to do with Wei Cheng?

521
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.300
We should have thought of it early.

522
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.200
Shen Yufei's husband,
Wei Cheng, works in math.

523
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.600
Those auxiliary calculations will
ultimately serve him.

524
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.600
Then we'd better visit him.

525
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.900
(Wei Cheng)

526
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.400
Your Majesty,
please give the great order!

527
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.600

Ready to go!

535
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.800
As ordered by the great emperor,
turn on the computer!

536
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.800
System self-test!

537
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.000
Your Majesty,
we have named this computer Qin I.

538
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:48.200
Look, there in the center is the CPU,
the core computing component,

539
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.800
formed from your five best divisions.

540
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.800
The part that's closest to us
is the display.

541
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.900
It will show us the main parameters
of the computation.

542
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.100
Self-test complete!

543
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.400
Begin boot sequence!

544
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.000
Load operating system!

545
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.800
You also used my cavalry?

546
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.600
Yes.

547
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.100
They're responsible for transmitting
information in the whole system.

548
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.800
The passage of the whole formation
they will run through

549
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.600
is the bus.

550
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.400
What's the bus?

551
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.600
The bus architecture
is a great invention.

552
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.000
If we have new needs or
new plug-in components,

553
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.400
even if they're made from
up to ten divisions,

554
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.400
we can quickly add them
to the main operation bus.

555
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.400
This allows Qin I's hardware to
be easily expanded and upgraded,

556
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.100
and enables us to deal with
various levels of computation.

557
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.300
Is there anything else?

558
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.700
The last part, look further still,

559
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.200
you might have to use the telescope.

560
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.400
There's the external storage.

561
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.800
External storage?

562
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.600
I don't like the name.

563
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.200
Why don't we call it "hard drive",
Your Majesty?

564
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.600
Hard drive?

565
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.200
Interesting.

566
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.600
Then let's call it hard drive.

567
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.800
Copernicus, you're really talented.

568
00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.600
It's formed by three million people
with more education than most.

569
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.200
Education?

570
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.400
Are they...

571
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400
Exactly.

572
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.100
The ones you saved when you
buried all those scholars alive.

573
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.000
What can they do?

574
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.200
Each of them holds a notepad and a pen
to record the calculations

575
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.500
and store intermediate
calculation results.

576
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.800
They're the bottleneck
for the speed of computation.

577
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.200
These people either fail to help
or make matters worse.

578
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.800
System lockup!

579
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.400
Malfunction reason determined.

580
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.400
There was an error with the operation

581
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.400
of one of the gates
in the CPU status register.

582
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.000
Your Majesty,
in order to improve system stability,

583
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.900
you should take certain
maintenance measures

584
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.000
with respect to faulty components.

585
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Replace the malfunctioning component.

586
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.500
Yes.

587
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.200
All the soldiers who made up that gate,
behead!

588
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.600
Any malfunctions will be
dealt with the same way.

589
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.200
Run solar orbit computation software
"Three Body 1.0"!

590
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.900
Start the master computing module!

591
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.400
Load the differential calculus module!

592
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.500
Load the spectral method module!

593
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.100
Enter initial condition parameters

594
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.200
and begin calculation!

595
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.400
It seems to be
the Qin 1.0 operating system.

596
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.600
Right.

597
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.400
The formation is the hardware.

598
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.700
What's on this paper is the software.

599
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.000
The hardware and software are like...

600
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
The guqin zither and sheet music.

601
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.100
Exactly.

602
00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.200
Your Majesty, you're certainly a great emperor!

603
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.600
Your Majesty, you're wise!

604
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.200
Get off.

605
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.800
After entering the motion vectors
of the three suns

606
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.100
at a particular moment
obtained by observation,

607
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.100
the software's operation will give us

608
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.600
a prediction for the suns' motion
at any moment in the future.

609
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.400
Our first computation
will calculate all the suns' positions

610
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.200
for the next two years.

611
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.600
Each set of output values will be
one 120 hours apart.

612
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.400
For the human-formation computer,
it's such a long calculation.

613
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.800
Each individual's behavior is so simple,

614
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.800
yet together, they can produce
such a complex, great whole!

615
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.000
Sure, Your Majesty.

616
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.200
Human has great power.

617
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.100
Europeans criticize me
for my tyrannical rule,

618
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.000
claiming that I suppress creativity.

619
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.600
But a large number of men
yoked by severe discipline

620
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.600
can also produce great wisdom
when bound together as one.

621
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.800
Great Emperor, this is just the mechanical
operation of a machine, not wisdom.

622
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.200
Each of these lowly individuals
is just a zero.

623
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.000
Only when someone like you
is added to the front as a one

624
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.200
can the whole have any meaning.

625
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.200
If, in the end, the results computed according
to your theory and mathematical model

626
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.000
don't match reality,
then you and I aren't even zeroes.

627
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.400
Indeed.

628
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.700
If that turns out to be the case,
you will be nothing.

629
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.700
The game should be sped up.
