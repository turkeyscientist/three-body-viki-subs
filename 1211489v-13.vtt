2
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.550
Such irregularity in the sun's movement in the game is beyond our comprehension, just like the universe flicker.

3
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.760
It's incomprehensible.

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.770
I'm beginning to understand this game.

5
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.230
Maybe we'll know the reason for the universe flicker when we find the pattern of the sun's movement.

6
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
Shen Yufei's right. The answer is in the game.

7
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.270
Alright.Drive safe.

8
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.860
Night.

9
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.640
What's the matter?

10
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.570
That Sha Ruishan guy made so many discoveries in a single gaming session.

11
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.670
Is it because he specializes in astrophysics?

12
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.320
Of course.

13
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.430
Well, if that's the case, I think you have a very capable helper.

14
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.890
Who?

15
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.780
Ye Wenjie.

16
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.920
She's an astrophysicist, and she has more leisure than Sha Ruishan does.

17
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.680
Maybe she even likes chatting.

18
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.460
Just think about it.

19
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.840
Why did you advise Wang Miao to meet Ye Wenjie?

20
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.600
I couldn't shake the feeling that she took Yang Dong's death too calmly.

21
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.100
Did you find anything about the reporter?

22
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.940
Hello?

23
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.240
Ms. Ye, sorry to disturb you at this hour.

24
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.840
May I ask when you're free?

25
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.590
I need to ask you a few questions.

26
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.150
Okay.

27
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.400
I'll wait there for you.

28
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400
Bye, Ms. Ye.

Hello?

Hello? Hi.

48
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.680
Do you have any news clues to offer?

49
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890
I want to speak to Mu Xing.

50
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.160
Is it because you have some news clues for her?

51
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.070
Put this away.

52
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.260
Mu Xing, why don't you just hire an operator?

53
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.410
What are you reporting this time?

54
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.160
Isn't it obvious?

55
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.040
Excessive emissions.

56
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.930
How did you get all those news clues?

57
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.120
There are always people providing clues.

58
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.360
The more people like me there are, the harder it is to obscure the truth.

59
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.580
(M·X STUDIO Displays a real world)

60
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.480
People like you?

61
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.360
What are you guys trying to do?

62
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.190
To let more people see the truth.

63
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.360
There's nothing wrong in that, but the focus of your reports is a bit problematic.

64
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.920
A pharmaceutical company has emission problems,

65
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.270
but you didn't condemn the regulator, or urge the people involved to fix it.

66
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.850
Instead, you kept warning people about the development of science and technology,

67
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.920
turning them into enemies of science. Why did you do that?

68
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.680
What people should guard against is the hazard brought by science and technology,

69
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.650
not science and technology themselves.

70
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.480
Besides, I just showed people the truth.

71
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.630
- I didn't interfere in their choices.
- That's not true.

72
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.360
I think you obviously interfered.

73
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.070
Who are you guys exactly?

74
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.390
You don't have to ask that when you replace "you guys" with "we".

75
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.680
Then who are we?

76
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.630
We?

77
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.630
We are people who live on this planet,

78
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.060
enjoying the conveniences science brings us and enduring the hazards it causes.

79
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.830
I want to become the one revealing the truth,

80
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.480
while you are the one trying to obscure the truth.

81
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.950
If I wanted to obscure the truth, I would've arrested you already.

82
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.390
You did arrest me once,

83
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.920
but pity you didn't give me any useful clues the other day.

84
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.710
If someday you find some useful clue, feel free to come and arrest me.

85
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.610
I read your reports. You weren't always like this.

86
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.510
You used to be very objective when stating the facts,

87
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.000
but now, your reports are obviously misleading in a sinister way.

88
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.840
Just think about it. Why did it come to this?

89
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.160
Sooner or later I'll find out who you guys really are.

90
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.160
Alright then, let's investigate together.

91
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.600
(There was an explosion in a lab earlier this morning.)

92
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.830
(Several of the country's top scientists were conducting an experiment.)

93
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.270
We're in charge of this thing now.

94
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:07.390
We'll tell the public that the scientists died in an unfortunate accident during the experiment.

95
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.950
What occurred is much worse.

96
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.270
(The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.)

97
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.850
(Stay tuned for more details.)

98
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.830
The enemy has already begun his massacre.

99
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.900
They're playing bridge in one of their monthly get-togethers.

100
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.120
There's even a Nobel Prize winner.

101
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.310
They're getting more bold.

102
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.800
We can't just sit around.

103
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.700
We need to react.

104
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.480
(Incoming Call from Shen Yufei)

105
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.100
So the protection of the vulnerable is still ineffective?

106
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.040
General Chang, you can't predict the enemy.

107
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.720
Hello?

108
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.050
You went too far.

109
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.380
Four scientists, and one of them even won a Nobel Prize.

110
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.380
Every one of them had the potential to make a breakthrough in Three-Body research.

111
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.540
Did I ever get in your business?

112
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.100
So you guys had better stay out of mine.

113
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.080
I think both of us should do Lord's bidding.

114
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.140
Us?

115
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.980
On the surface, we are on the same side, but in fact, we are mortal enemies.

116
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.060
Yes.

117
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.420
You people have been using Lord's powers against mankind.

118
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.420
That's one way to put it.

119
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.460
We need Lord to come to our world and mete out the long overdue punishment to the sinners,

120
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:39.240
but you are being a hindrance, so we are irreconcilable enemies.

121
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.420
Lord should not be used by you people.

122
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.680
You are not serving Lord either.

123
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.750
If you don't stop, we'll make you stop.

124
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.420
You think the Commander will allow that?

125
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.740
The Commander?

126
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.200
Wasn't it the Commander who caused all this?

127
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.500
This is your car, right? Sorry. I hit it.

128
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.420
I'm really sorry.

129
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.700
Your words enlightened me.

130
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.220
All I saw on the paper was your theory.

131
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.460
It surprises me that you've put it into practice to such an extent.

132
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.090
But there are still many unsolved problems.

133
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.080
The matter of manufacture will be settled sooner or later.

134
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.590
Like I said, your research on applied physics is very realistic.

135
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.540
But my knowledge base is still too small.

136
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.740
Otherwise I wouldn't have disturbed you

137
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.220
and asked you so many questions about the movement of fixed stars.

138
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.620
Thank you for coming here, Ms. Ye.

139
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.940
The theories I told you about are available in books.

140
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.820
Your lab is a real eye-opener for me.

141
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.080
Let's just say we're learning from each other.

142
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.140
I got another question for you.

143
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.660
Do you know flying stars?

144
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.570
Flying stars?

145
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.640
Are you referring to meteors,

146
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.540
or fixed stars with unstable spin and orbital periods?

147
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.580
Fixed stars.

148
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.060
Spin…

149
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.000
Unstable spin and orbital periods?

150
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.940
Fixed stars with unstable spin and orbital periods?

151
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.400
Oh, this way, please.

152
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.900
I suddenly thought of a friend.

153
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:11.780
Every time he hears the words flying stars, he'll say that they're stars aimlessly whooshing around.

154
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.940
That's one way to put it.

155
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.440
I remember that ten-odd years ago,

156
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.500
there were some foreign books and papers concerning that,

157
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.920
so we read some of them and did some research,

158
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.060
but it was unfruitful.

159
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:36.260
If you'd like to know more about it, I can recommend two books to you.

160
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.480
Okay.

161
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.020
This is my office.

162
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.500
Ms. Ye, have a seat.

163
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.300
Sorry to trouble you.

164
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.760
Please write the names of the books here.

165
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.260
Ms. Ye,

166
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.600
this is the red ginseng you gave me. 
 <i>[Red Ginseng]</i>

167
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.680
I make tea with it quite often.

168
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.860
It's pretty good.

169
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.680
Thank you.

170
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:54.180
You look much better now, but this red ginseng is not good enough.

171
00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:00.240
There used to be first-class wild mountain
ginseng near our workplace.

172
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.960
You may take the outlooks of these books for reference.

173
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.280
The Structure and Evolution of Stars. Stellar Movements and the Structure of the Universe.

174
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.700
Okay.

175
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.720
These two books might not be easy to find.

176
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.340
They're too old.

177
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.540
The names I wrote are the original ones.

178
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.800
I think there are new editions now.

179
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.300
These kinds of materials are easy to find nowadays.

180
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.800
This is a much better era.

181
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.020
When I was your age, we needed to apply beforehand to look up things in books.

182
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.940
It was quite an effort.

183
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.480
Many people stayed in the reference room

184
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.240
for days without eating or sleeping after they finally got into it.

185
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.380
I remember I once watched a documentary about Two bombs and One Satellite.

186
00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.840
The last generation of scientists are quite admirable in terms of both imagination and creativity.

187
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.610
Now we're living in peaceful times, and the Internet is so highly developed,

188
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.600
but I still feel humbled.

189
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:16.380
The scientists contemporary with you are the real legend.

190
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.420
Legend?

191
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.760
You wouldn't have felt it that way had you experienced it.

192
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.980
Ms. Ye, the other day you told me something happened when you were in the Construction Corps.

193
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.700
Afterwards, you went to another place.

194
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.640
What's that place like?

195
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.820
The place I went to
was named Red Coast.

196
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.130
Red Coast?

197
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.600
I read a book about Red Coast.

198
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.540
The author's the developer of Red Coast's self-interpretation system.

199
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.760
I think he emigrated to Europe afterwards.

200
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.120
Is what he says in the book real?

201
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.980
I know that book.

202
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.320
The author is somewhat irresponsible.

203
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.430
Many of the contents of the book are not factual.

204
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.260
Then what really did happen?

205
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.780
I'm sorry, Ms. Ye.

206
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.720
I was being presumptuous.

207
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.160
Sorry.

208
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.660
No.

209
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.840
Correcting them is what I should do.

210
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.570
At that time,

211
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.020
I thought my life was over,

212
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:55.060
and I might even die in that room.

213
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.180
This is the person you want. I've handled all the formalities.

214
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.300
You know the nature of this, right?

215
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.000
Do you have any idea how much trouble I had to go through to transfer her?

216
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.460
It would never have been so difficult if you could transfer her above board.

217
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.640
First, the project is highly confidential.

218
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.880
More importantly, there are strict confidentiality regulations.

219
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.320
With such a long isolation period, you may forget about those with family members.

220
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.960
I almost had to forcefully move her.

221
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.440
Weren't the two people doing pretty good?

222
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.100
They would rather stay at the May Seventh Cadre School.

223
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.620
This kind of unconventional transfer must not happen again.

224
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.100
Let me tell you something.

225
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.240
Your project itself is unconventional.

226
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.100
If something goes wrong, I'll accept the responsibility.

227
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.120
You really think you can take responsibility for this?

228
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.780
You are a technical person, but Red Coast is not like other national defense projects.

229
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.420
Its complexity goes far beyond the technical issues.

230
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.540
So you do know it's complex.

231
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.460
The country in the north is doing it, and so are the western countries,

232
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.020
but you won't even give me any manpower.

233
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.680
How am I supposed to complete the task?

234
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.600
What do you mean by I…

235
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.400
Are you okay?

236
00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.520
Possible Energy Interfaces in the Solar Radiation Zone and Their Reflective Properties.

237
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.360
Was it you who wrote this paper?

238
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.880
If it wasn't her, why would I have you get her here?

239
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.540
Where are we going?

240
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.520
Red Coast Base.

241
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.420
Lei Zhicheng was the political commissar of Red Coast Base.

242
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.640
Yang Weining was the chief engineer.

243
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.680
If they hadn't moved me,

244
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.720
everything…

245
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.680
everything would've been entirely different.

246
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.980
What were they researching in the Red Coast Base exactly?

247
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.780
I know you specialize in astrophysics.

248
00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:00.010
Did they come to you because of your speciality?

249
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.800
That was what I thought at the beginning.

250
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.220
Yang Weining was a good guy.

251
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.500
Come.

252
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.300
Have a seat.

253
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.160
Shao Lin, this is Yang Weining.

254
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.700
this is Yang Weining.

255
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.230
He just became my graduate student.

256
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.760
This is my wife.

257
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.450
Hi, Mrs. Ye.

258
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.960
Have a seat.

259
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.260
Sit.

260
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.380
What topic are you researching?

261
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.780
It's about experimental and applied physics.

262
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.520
Oh, it's pretty similar to mine.

263
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.040
Your mentor researches theoretical physics.

264
00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.180
I want to devote myself to this era and make some actual contributions.

265
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.280
Theories are the foundation of application.

266
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.920
Isn't discovering the laws of nature the greatest contribution to this era?

267
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.740
This is our home.

268
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.580
You may say whatever you want.

269
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.010
Yeah.

270
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:29.530
I feel theoretical research tends to... mess with people's minds.

271
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.250
Ye, you got yourself a good student.

272
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.000
Mrs. Ye, I bought you some fruits.

273
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.600
I… I'll go wash them for you.

274
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.780
This graduate student is pretty good.

275
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.200
He's balanced and pragmatic.

276
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.780
He's got very good grades, and excels at maths.

277
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.820
Pity his attitude towards science is not sincere enough.

278
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.180
Well, I think he's very sincere.

279
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.040
He's pretty practical, and he does want to contribute.

280
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.000
In the long run, people like him are more likely to create value.

281
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.600
Science is science.

282
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.660
Truth is truth.

283
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.880
There's no in-between.

284
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.660
Okay, okay.

285
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.520
We never reached an agreement on this.

286
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.680
Since Yang Weining was your father's graduate student, he figured out a way to move you?

287
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.580
He was in charge of the project in Red Coast.

288
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.140
Red Coast was short-handed, and I got the right speciality.

289
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:50.160
Otherwise, in that era, he wouldn't have been able to help me.

290
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:58.050
But even so, he was taking great risks doing that.

291
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:05.260
He was really a good guy.

292
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.920
Political Commissar Lei.

293
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.220
Chief Engineer Yang.

294
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.760
Thanks, but I can manage it myself.

295
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.260
Get the supplies to the storeroom for registration!

296
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.820
Yes!

297
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.200
Come on. This way.

298
00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.810
Ye Wenjie, I'm offering you a chance.

299
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.380
This is a national defense scientific-research base.

300
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.340
Your expertise might be useful for the ongoing research in there.

301
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:16.180
Chief Engineer Yang will tell you the details, but whether you can seize this chance depends on you.

302
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.670
I've talked to the military control commission.

303
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.900
Although Cheng Lihua advocates sentencing you severely,

304
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.860
considering your actions, I think you'll get ten years or so.

305
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.420
If you perform well during the ten years, your sentence might be commuted.

306
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.440
But here is a research project under the highest security classification.

307
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.360
Professor Ye…

308
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.860
Ye Zhetai made a mistake, and so did you.

309
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:59.440
Therefore, given your status, if you enter the gate, it's possible you'll never leave for the rest of your life.

310
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.540
I want to go in.

311
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.100
Don't be hasty.

312
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.180
The helicopter will take off in three hours.

313
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.260
Take your time and think it through.

314
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.300
If you refuse our offer, I'll get you back.

315
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.370
Let's go in.

316
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.580
You should be cautious.

317
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.880
Do you know what it means to go in?

318
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.380
I'm willing to stay here for the rest of my life.

319
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.940
At that time, apart from the underworld which nobody knows if it exists,

320
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:48.360
the place I wanted to go to the most was this sequestered place.

321
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.790
The Red Coast Base was so mysterious.

322
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.200
What did they research in there exactly?

323
00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.980
(So many things were done with haste.)

324
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.260
(The earth rotates nonstop. Time flies.)

325
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.760
(10,000 years are too long. We need to seize the day.)

326
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.340
(The future is bright. The path is winding.)

327
00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.100
(We need to harden our resolve, dismiss our fear of death,)

328
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.100
(overcome all obstacles, and fight for victory.)

329
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.960
(Those on duty in the Transmission Department, attention, please.)

330
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.900
(Those on duty in the Transmission Department, attention, please.)

331
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.480
(The computer magnetic core storage in the Transmission Department displays a failure code.)

332
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.940
(Maintenance personnel are to go and fix it immediately.)

333
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.480
(The computer magnetic core storage in the Transmission Department displays a failure code.)

334
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.340
(Maintenance personnel are to go and fix it immediately.)

335
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.740
(Range of monitored frequency: r1,000 to 40,000 MHz.)

336
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.780
(Number of monitored channels: 15,000.)

337
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.860
(At 5:00 PM, there will be a sanitary check)

338
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.540
(on the mainframe cabinet between transmitters and receivers.)

339
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.620
(Please prepare ahead of time.)

340
00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.260
(A routine work meeting will be held after the transmission.)

341
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.340
Who are you?

342
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.240
(Department heads are to attend on time.)

343
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:17.980
(Comrades, we are conducting glorious and steadfast socialist construction.)

344
00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.140
(Building and Protecting Our Great Motherland)
(We should harness from the work,)

345
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.740
(A Spark Can Grow Into an Inferno,)

346
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.540
(the power that'll help us overcome any obstacle.)

347
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.980
(Today, we re-read A Spark Can Grow Into an Inferno.)

348
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.820
(Under the guidance of our great leader, Chairman Mao,)

349
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:42.080
(we'll surmount all difficulties and triumph.)

350
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.660
Chief Engineer Yang, there's a change in the shift schedule.

351
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.580
Have a look.

352
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.340
This is a large-scale weapons research project.

353
00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.320
If it succeeds,

354
00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:02.180
the result will be even more important than the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb.

355
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:10.340
(The Monitoring Department will now announce)

356
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.980
(the schedule of the next night shift.)

357
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.620
(Monday, Transmission...)

358
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.980
This is the smell of machine oil.

359
00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.160
It's pretty strong, but bearable.

360
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.420
You'll get used to it soon enough.

361
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.260
Chief Engineer Yang.

362
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.180
Your room isn't ready yet.

363
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.240
You may go in with me.

364
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.400
I'll just wait here.

365
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.900
You're a staff member now.

366
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.600
You can go anywhere with only a few exceptions.

367
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.740
I'll just wait here.

368
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.340
Chief Engineer Yang, take a look at this set of data.

369
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.800
Are you…

370
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.300
The conditions here are poor.

371
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.660
There's no heating in the house.

372
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.580
- Zhang. 
 - I'm here!

373
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.720
When a fire is made in her room, take her there to have some rest.

374
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.380
Yes!

375
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.260
Take it.

376
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.770
Take it.

377
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.020
Put it on.

378
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.560
Let's go.

379
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.440

Thirteen.

409
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.020
Twelve.

410
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.140
Eleven.

411
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.160

Begin transmission!

422
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.200
All units continue to monitor!

423
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.380
You feel itchy, right?

424
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:47.840
Every time it transmits, my hands and face feel itchy, and it makes me feel warm.

425
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.260
Sparrows.

426
00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.980
(Malfunction with Coding Unit. The codes are problematic.)

427
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.780
Recheck it.

428
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.540
(The codes are problematic.)

429
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.860
Is there any solar radiation interference?

430
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.680
Report. No solar radiation interference detected.

(Computer processing error message.)

433
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.500
Report. The electric current is growing.

434
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.340
(Maintenance personnel are to check the circuits immediately.)

435
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.180
(I repeat.)

436
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.940
Malfunction with Amplifier unit. Magnetron No. 3 has burnt out.

437
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.740
Backup Unit is in operation.

438
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.160
Checkpoint one reached.

439
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.100
Turn it again.

440
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.680
Circuits undamaged.

441
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:52.220
Transmission 147 of Red Coast Project completed.

442
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.900
Transmission systems shutting down. Red Coast now entering monitoring state.

443
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.580
System control is hereby transferred to the Monitoring Department.

444
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.820
Please upload checkpoint data.

445
00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.200
All units should fill out transmission diaries.

446
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.540
All unit heads should attend the post-transmission meeting in the debriefing room.

447
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.190
We're done.

448
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.680
Where's BN20197F?

449
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.500
I don't know that either.

450
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.900
I think it's over there.

451
00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.320
Over there.

452
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.080
There was a giant antenna, and a powerful electric field.

453
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.520
The Red Coast was under such a high security classification.

454
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.820
Were there many restrictions as well?

455
00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.620
All those restrictions were necessary.

456
00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.380
For example, the leave-of-absence mechanism.

457
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:10.500
Every time I wanted to go out, the approval process was easy for me.

458
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:30.720
Besides, when I first joined Red Coast, my workload was really light.

459
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.700
I often climbed to the mountaintop to see the sunrise.

460
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.460
You got up so early.

461
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.520
I used to get up early to work. I've taken to it.

462
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.700
You start working so early?

463
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.090
All devices need double-checking.

464
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.960
You've always been a meticulous guy.

465
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.720
Professor Ye… He…

466
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:27.040
Seen from here, the northern tree farm is really pitch-dark.

467
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.820
I never thought I'd come back in a month.

468
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.440
Back?

469
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.160
Yeah.

470
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.500
Previously, I looked up here from down there.

471
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.580
And now, I'm looking down there from up here.

472
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.860
Be careful.

473
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.800
I was scared of this place when I first came here.

474
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.960
It struck me as bottomless.

475
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.900
Now it's growing on me.

476
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.300
This is the quietest spot in the base.

477
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.240
I can stay here for the rest of my life.
