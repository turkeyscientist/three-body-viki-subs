4
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.400
(An hour in the morning
is worth two in the evening.)

5
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.000
(Comrades, let's perk ourselves up
and welcome this brand new day.)

6
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600
(According to the latest
weather forecast,)

7
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.300
(from 8:00 AM today
to 8:00 AM tomorrow,)

8
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.400
(there will be light snow
in some areas of the northeast.)

9
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.000
When I first joined the Red Coast Base, they didn't give me a fixed job.

10
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I was just doing technology-related
odds and ends,

11
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.700
and there was a security guard
supervising me doing that.

12
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.100
It's okay. I can manage it myself.

13
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.600
What did you do exactly?

14
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.500
Why do they want you watched
even when you're cleaning a machine?

15
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.200
I made a serious mistake.

16
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.800
A serious mistake?

17
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400
What serious mistake
could you possibly have made?

18
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.200
You?

19
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200
I don't believe it.

20
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.400
What's wrong?

21
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.300
It's indeed problematic.

22
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400
You're in charge here?

23
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.300
Why didn't you notice this?

24
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.800
Fix it right now.

25
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.200
Yes.

26
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.600
Impressive.

27
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.700
You know experiments, and you have pretty strong observation ability.

28
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.200
When I was in college, my mentor told me that an astrophysicist

29
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.200
wouldn't achieve anything without experiment skills and observation abilities, however good at theories they were.

30
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.600
At least that's the case in our country.

31
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.500
Compared with your father…

32
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.400
Compared with his opinion,
this is entirely different.

33
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.200
Theories are the foundation
of application.

34
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.800
I feel theoretical research tends to
mess with people's minds.

35
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.500
There are so many terms in physics.

36
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.800
Will changing the names be enough?

37
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
I tend to agree with this opinion.

38
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.200
He was too obsessed with theories.

39
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.200
(I will now announce the night shift schedule for next week.)

40
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.000
(Monday: Transmission Department.)

41
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.400
But I'm not surprised.

42
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.800
Your mentor is the doyen of radio astronomy in our country.

43
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.000
Highly respected.

44
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.100
He was the reason
I became interested in radio astronomy.

45
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.200
I taught myself some electronic
engineering and computer knowledge.

46
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.100
Without the expertise in the two fields, I wouldn't have found the glitch.

47
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.600
That's right.

48
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.800
By the way,
what's your postgraduate topic?

49
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.500
I participated in the debugging of the first small radio telescope in our country with my mentor.

50
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.600
It was during that period that I accumulated quite some experience in this field.

51
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.500
I never thought this expertise
would come in handy in this place.

52
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.800
Yang.

53
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.600
Political Commissar.

54
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.600
The glitch's fixed?

55
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.000
Yeah.

56
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.200
You found it?

57
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.800
She found it.

58
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.000
You have experience in radio astronomy?

59
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.600
As chance would have it,
she does know a thing or two.

60
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.800
That's good.

61
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.200
We may move her here
for the maintenance.

62
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.100
People who can find such glitches
are a rare breed here.

63
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.600
Okay. I'll think about it.

64
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.400
What's there to think about?

65
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.800
Wenjie,
from now on, you're in charge here.

66
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.200
Well, Lei…

67
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.000
I need to talk to you about Liu.
Come over here.

68
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.400
No…

69
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.700
Liu is incompetent
and lacks professionalism.

70
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.800
Why does the stuff he overhauled
keep malfunctioning?

71
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm speaking to you.

72
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.700
I'm listening.

73
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.900
You were the one who brought him here,
and now he proved incompetent.

74
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.500
Should we keep him or weed him out?

75
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800
Liu, right?

76
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.000
Yeah.

77
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.600
Well, Liu…

78
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.800
I'll knock some sense into him.

79
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.200
That won't improve his competence.

80
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.800
Well, sure, knocking sense into people
is also a very important task.

(Forward the Revolutionary

91
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.900
I couldn't tell if my heartfelt joy was because of the long-lost trust,

92
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.800
or because of the monotonous busyness.

93
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.200
But that was a feeling of great relief.

in the debriefing room this afternoon.)

99
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.200
Hey, why don't you eat in the mess hall?

100
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.400
That'll make a difference?

101
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.400
Of course it does.

102
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.000
In the mess hall,
you may eat with the others.

103
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.500
I always eat alone.

104
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.600
Uh, how many machines do you have to check later?

105
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.000
Six.

106
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800
S… Six?

107
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.800
Well, is Liu absent from work again?

108
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.400
You're doing his job for him?

109
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.000
He's sick.

110
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.600
The hell he is.

111
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.200
That guy is always shirking.

112
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.000
In the past, he had to work, but now you've come, so he keeps faking being sick.

113
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
At this rate, you'll soon become a technical cadre here.

114
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.600
Don't say that.

115
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600
I don't like him.

(The computer magnetic core storage in the Transmission Department displays a failure code.)

165
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.400
(Maintenance personnel
are to go and fix it immediately.)

166
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.000
Liu, check this out.

167
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.600
We've found the reason.
Tell everybody it's because of No. 1731.

168
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.800
Alright.

169
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.000
Malfunctioning device identified.
It's No. 1731.

170
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.800
(The 151st transmission
of Red Coast Project is finished.)

171
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.800
Malfunctioning device identified.
It's No. 1731.

172
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.200
(Red Coast entering detection mode.)

173
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.700
(Monitoring Department, please take over system control and upload the break point data.)

174
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.200
(All units are to fill in the forms
in the transmission logs carefully.)

175
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.600
(Group leaders are to go to the meeting
room for regular transmission meeting.)

176
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.300
I've checked the data.

177
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.000
There's nothing wrong.

178
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.200
The problem lies in your devices.

179
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.400
You know better than me that's not true.

180
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.000
You're just… You're just trying
to have me take the fall.

181
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.800
You know better than me
if you should take the fall as well.

182
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.600
Yang Weining,
you just want me to be your scapegoat.

183
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
(All units are to carefully fill in the forms in the transmission log about the malfunction of No. 1731.)

184
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.200
(Group leaders are to go to the meeting
room for regular transmission meeting.)

185
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.500
Actually, Liu has identified
the problem already.

186
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.200
He also figured out a solution.

187
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.400
He put it all in the maintenance report,

188
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.400
but someone crossed it out.

189
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.000
I see.

190
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.200
Liu is actually much more professional
than he seems.

191
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.400
Yeah.

192
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.900
All technical military officers here
are the best in PLA Rocket Force.

193
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.100
I'll never be able to catch up with him in terms of electronic and computer expertise.

194
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.600
It doesn't matter anymore.

195
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.600
Anyway, he's leaving.

196
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.500
That's what I'm trying to say.

197
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.600
Liu is competent.

198
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.300
You shouldn't…

199
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.000
It'd be a shame if he got expelled.

200
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.400
A shame?

201
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.600
You're so naive.

202
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.400
You think I'm the reason he's leaving?

203
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.800
Living conditions are very poor
in this godforsaken place.

204
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.600
Of course,
those things can be overcome,

205
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.600
but you should know very well what a scientific researcher values the most.

206
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:03.300
It's the prospects of achievements, but the research and development of Red Coast systems is over.

207
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.500
There are no prospects
for achievements anymore.

208
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:17.100
And Liu is fully aware
that in a top-level project like this,

209
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.600
once he accepts a core position, he'll have to stay here forever.

210
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.200
He's leaving on his own account?

211
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.200
Liu is a smart guy.

212
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.100
In his domain, he counts as a genius,

213
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.800
but he chose to pretend to be a fool.

214
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.000
Do you know who revised this report? 
 (Equipment Maintenance Report)

215
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.900
He himself?

216
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.600
Yeah.

217
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.700
He did it himself.

218
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.600
He can't slack off, so when we tell him to go east, he'll try his best to go west.

219
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.600
He's playing dumb,
and he's a master of it.

220
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600
He won.

221
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.000
Lei has talked to me many times
about his competence.

222
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.800
He said Liu's no good, that he's incompetent, and unprofessional, and wasting a post.

223
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.400
"Just let him go."

224
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.200
What could I say?

225
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.600
I could only steel myself.

226
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.200
But now I feel this won't work.

227
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.800
At this rate, sooner or later he'll resort to sabotage,

228
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.800
which will be a serious mistake.

229
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.400
He didn't resort to sabotage.

230
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.200
I'm not Cheng Lihua.

231
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.800
If Liu really wants out,
I'll let him go.

232
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.800
But I got to give you a note of caution.

233
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.600
After filling the vacancy, you should just do your job, which is maintenance.

234
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.000
Do not meddle in anything else.

235
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.700
I just can't stand Liu anymore.

236
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.000
You may leave.

237
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.400
Stay here.

238
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.400
I know if I chuck Liu out right now,
you might worry about his replacement.

239
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.200
Am I right?

240
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.200
Well, Wenjie is a suitable candidate.

241
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.100
She studied electronics, and computer science, and she's also got expertise in radio astronomy.

242
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.800
A very suitable, all-around candidate.

243
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.200
It can't be her.

244
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.700
Why can't it be her?

245
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.300
Expertise can be improved over time.

246
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.100
Attitude is the key.

247
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.800
Wenjie is very responsible,
and she's yearning to improve herself.

248
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.000
I can guarantee you
she'll soon outshine Liu in expertise.

249
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Wenjie, neither I nor Weining obsesses about people's past and ignores the change in them.

250
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.200
I promise we'll assess you
in a fair and objective way.

251
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.000
I disagree.

252
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.200
Why do you disagree?

253
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.600
She's unfit to enter the core
of Red Coast.

254
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.800
Can we stop talking about the past?

255
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.200
Even Chairman Mao says
we should see things dialectically.

256
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.170
We can't fix our eyes on her past
and ignore the changes in her.

257
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.600
I think Wenjie's been performing
very well since her arrival.

258
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.200
Gi…Give us the room.

259
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.200
- Her problem is not a small one.
 - Well.

260
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.500
You were the one
who insisted I move her here,

261
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.500
but now you refuse to put her to work.
What the heck are you playing at?

262
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.400
Yeah, I got her here, but I only want her for maintenance.

263
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.000
She's unfit to enter the core
of Red Coast.

264
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.600
Why?

265
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.000
She made mistakes.

266
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.400
Yang Weining, even I, the political
commissar, have no worries about that.

267
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.700
Why are you concerned about it?

268
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.200
I think Ye Wenjie is suitable for it.

269
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.800
(Forward the Revolutionary
and Improve Productivity)

270
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.600
Although Political Commissar Lei and Yang Weining had a wide divergence of opinion,

271
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.100
eventually, I still took Liu's place.

272
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:17.700
(PLA Rocket Force, the 152nd regular transmission of Red Coast Project, authorization confirmed.)

273
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.800
(30 seconds to go.)

274
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.200
Transmission document number: 27.

275
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.600

276
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.600
Relay: none.

(The 152nd transmission
of Red Coast Project is successful.)

278
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.000

(Red Coast entering detection mode.)

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:54.300
(Monitoring Department, please take over system control and conduct the reception of data.)

282
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.900
(All units are to fill in the forms
in the transmission logs carefully.)

283
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.400
(Over.)

284
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.060
You've come.

285
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.640
The organization has made a decision.

286
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.780
From here on out, Liu's position will be yours.

287
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.800
You'll be in charge of the core work of the Transmission Department.

288
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.920
You need to keep it up, and stay meticulous and responsible.

289
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.370
I'll caution you once again.

290
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.510
Stay out of things you shouldn't meddle in,

291
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.940
- especially the kind that…
- Report.

292
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.580
Chief Engineer Yang.

293
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.030
I've heard.

294
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.890
Our leaders had a meeting and deliberated on it.

295
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.070
You're now a cadre.

296
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.480
I need to get to work.

297
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.580
(Equipment Maintenance Report)

298
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.720
Wenjie.

299
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.060
Political Commissar Lei.

300
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.750
They told me you applied for entry into the reference room.

301
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.590
I did.

302
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.410
I need to look up the models of some machines.

303
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.400
I've told the security you may go to the reference room whenever you want.

304
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.340
Thank you for your trust, Political Commissar Lei.

305
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.810
For the moment, it's just the cybernation unit of the transmission system.

306
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.900
- We need to open it to you step by step.
(- OS: Wang.)

307
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.480
(OS: These data are problematic.)

308
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.310
I understand.

309
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.790
(- OS: Check them again.)
- Yes.

310
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:20.120
Why do you want to look up these models?

311
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.280
Lately I've come to know many core contents, so some questions arose in my mind.

312
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.900
This is an important confidential project of our country, but the devices here are too outdated.

313
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.920
Take the Transmission Department's computers for example.

314
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.550
Although there are three of them, all of them are even more primitive than DJSC30.

315
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.930
They're even still using cumbersome magnetic core memory and paper input tape.

316
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:45.240
They're too heavy, and their longest uptime did not exceed 15 hours.

317
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.540
I also checked Red Coast's targeting system.

318
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:53.720
Its precision is very low, probably not even on par with that of an artillery cannon.

319
00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:06.240
I understand your worries, but our country is in the early stage of construction.

320
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.480
To be specific, it's like a child.

321
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.720
Everything is waiting to be taken up. Just like the northern tree farm.

322
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.010
The objective conditions are undeniably poor,

323
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.830
but we have to strive when conditions are good,

324
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.000
and when conditions are poor, we have to improve the conditions and then strive.

325
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.110
We need to overcome all obstacles and work miracles.

326
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.620
This is all we need to do in Red Coast.

327
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.070
I understand.

328
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.070
I'll try my best.

329
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.730
Go. Get to work.

Wenjie.

342
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.850
Political Commissar Lei.

343
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:30.350
Wenjie, how long have you been working in the Transmission Department?

344
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.980
43 days.

345
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.310
You have a very good memory.

346
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.500
By now you're pretty familiar with the Transmission Department.

347
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.160
This is Red Coast's principal part, and also its offensive component.

348
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.590
I'd like to hear your views of the system as a whole.

349
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.800
Go ahead, speak your mind.

350
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.440
Political Commissar Lei, I'm just responsible for maintenance and repair.

351
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.550
As for Red Coast's overall condition, including its operation and targets,

352
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.400
I know nothing about those things.

353
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.920
I'm not allowed to know.

354
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.370
Your awareness is impressive, but it's also important to be practical and realistic.

355
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.410
If you do have something to say, you may just say it.

356
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.620
There's nobody else around.

357
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.730
The principal part of the transmission component,

358
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:35.130
when you come down to it, it's just a radio transmitter.

359
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.900
That's one way to put it.

360
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.200
Wenjie, do you know about microwave ovens?

361
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.030
They are a luxury plaything of the capitalist West.

362
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.410
Food is heated by the energy generated from absorbing microwave radiation.

363
00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.160
At my previous research station, in order to precisely test

364
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.480
the high-temperature aging of certain components, we imported one.

365
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.010
After work, we would use it to bake potatoes or warm mantou-bread.

366
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.590
It's very interesting.

367
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:18.720
The inside of the food heats up first while the outside remains cold.

368
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:24.160
Actually, Red Coast system is a giant microwave oven,

369
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:46.950
and its heating targets are the enemy's space vessels.

370
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.810
If we can apply microwave radiation at a specific power level of one-tenth of a watt to one watt per square centimeter,

371
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:55.520
we'll be able to disable or destroy many electronic components

372
00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:02.020
of satellite communications, radar, and navigation systems.

373
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.170
I see.

374
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.700
It's different from what you thought, right?

375
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:20.050
Though Red Coast system is just a radio transmitter, it's not a conventional device.

376
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:25.030
If its transmission power reaches 25 megawatts, that'll be really staggering.

377
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:30.760
This is not just more powerful than all communication transmissions, but also all radar transmissions.

378
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.540
That's right.

379
00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.260
Red Coast relies on a set of gigantic capacitors for energy.

380
00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.960
Because the power requirements are so high, its transmission circuits

381
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.850
are also entirely different from conventional designs.

382
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.270
Now I understand the purpose of such ultrahigh power in the system.

383
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:53.540
But emission from the system seems to be modulated.

384
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.790
Yeah.

385
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:59.030
However, the modulation is unlike that used in conventional radio communications.

386
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.790
The purpose isn't to add information.

387
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:14.030
It's to use a kind of shifting frequencies and amplitudes

388
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:20.790
to penetrate possible shielding deployed in the space by the enemy.

389
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.920
Of course, those are still experimental.

390
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.010
I see.

391
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.100
Thank you, Political Commissar Lei.

392
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.650
Recently, two target satellites were launched from Jiuquan.

393
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.720
We launched an effective attack with Red Coast system.

394
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.480
It was a complete success. The targets were destroyed.

395
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.750
Temperature inside the satellites reached nearly a thousand degrees,

396
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:53.300
and all instruments and photographic pequipment onboard were destroyed.

397
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.660
In future wars, Red Coast can effectively strike at the enemy's communication and reconnaissance satellites,

398
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.110
like KH-8, the principal spy satellites our opponent is using right now,

399
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.160
as well as the KH-9, which are about to be launched.

400
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.000
Of course, the low-orbit spy satellites are even more vulnerable.

401
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.510
If necessary, we even have the capacity to destroy

402
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:20.270
the Skylab station that the West plans on launching next year.

403
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.200
This is Red Coast.

404
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.970
You've come.

405
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.510
Wenjie, give us some privacy.

406
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.340
Yes.

407
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.060
Why did you tell her this?

408
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.450
Does she even believe it?

409
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.270
She believes it.

410
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.540
What's the point?

411
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.300
It's very risky to disclose such information to her.

412
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.880
I know Ye Wenjie is indeed problematic,

413
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.000
but she is also very competent, and she's got motivation.

414
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.110
She overshadows many people in the base.

415
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.550
What do you think we're doing here?

416
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.140
We need to make achievements.

417
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.640
Of course, we'll be doing it
for our country.

418
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.670
You picked me.

419
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:06.710
It was you who brought me to this base.

420
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.820
But you're too artless.

421
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.570
I can stay here for the rest of my life,

422
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.820
but even to this day, you still don't trust me.

423
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:34.130
Sometimes,
trust can drag you into an abyss.

424
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.510
The next day, I was transferred out of the Transmission Department.

425
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:35.220
I thought I'd never be able to enter the core of Red Coast again.

426
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.660
So it was Chief Engineer Yang who transferred you?

427
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:41.440
But it couldn't be.

428
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.510
In principle, Political Commissar Lei had way greater powers than Chief Engineer Yang.

429
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:51.180
After all, a political commissar has the final say on all important affairs.

430
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.440
Obviously, Lei Zhicheng made a personal decision

431
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.760
to tell me the Red Coast's true purpose.

432
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:04.480
I was really very grateful to him for the trust he placed in me,

433
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:12.490
because trust was a luxury I dared not even wish for at that time.

434
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.760
Maybe Chief Engineer Yang was a somewhat prudent guy.

435
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.590
That was what I thought.

436
00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:27.880
I felt Yang Weining was nothing more than a typical intellectual of the period.

437
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:35.700
I found his actions understandable, but we became estranged from each other.

438
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.060
Fortunately, Political Commissar Lei trusted you.

439
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.400
Yeah.

440
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.760
I feel he's a serviceman.

441
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.180
He had a soldier's frank and forthright manners.

442
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:58.090
In fact, from then on, everything changed.

443
00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.190
What happened next?

444
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:11.700
When time gets involved, the line between right and wrong becomes blurry.

445
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.190
Take Lei Zhicheng for example.

446
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:21.230
I learnt much later that all he told me was a lie.

447
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.190
A lie?

448
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.860
About the true purpose of Red Coast?

449
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.480
The true reason they built Red Coast

450
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.130
was far more important and complicated than he said it was.

451
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.800
And far more incredible.

452
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:50.480
Wasn't Red Coast for reconnoitering and destroying enemy countries' communication satellites?

453
00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.630
The true value of Red Coast…

454
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:17.290
Sorry, Wang, about this part, I cannot tell you yet.

455
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.280
I understand.

456
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.440
Sorry, Ms. Ye.

457
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.000
I asked too many questions, but I'm very grateful to you

458
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.440
for telling me so many interesting past events.

459
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.070
Thank you.

460
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.660
Red Coast was a giant microwave oven?

461
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.880
Then why did they keep it secret?

462
00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.880
Professor Ye didn't say it's a microwave oven.

463
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.710
It's your job to find out what it was.

464
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.320
I know. I know.

465
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.680
The archives are still classified.

466
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.540
Chang has been rushing them, and I've been rushing Chang.

467
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.440
Have you noticed this doubtful point?

468
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.900
Yang Weining.

469
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.400
What about him?

470
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.400
Yang Dong.

471
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.840
Yang Dong's surname was also Yang.

472
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.450
I was too embarrassed to ask her.

473
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.150
I can't believe this.

474
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.220
You are too thin-skinned.

475
00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.030
Do you still remember how I interrogated you that day?

476
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.660
I saw the look in your eyes when you saw Yang Dong's picture.

477
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.480
Your eyes just lit up.

478
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.000
What did I say? I said "You know her?"

479
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.230
(Yang Dong)
You know her?

480
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.940
You don't know her, but want to know her?

481
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.220
Don't overthink it.

482
00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.680
I'm just telling you a cop must not overlook any detail when looking into a case.

483
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.820
I'm not a cop.

484
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.710
I know.

485
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.270
But it's the same thing, isn't it?

486
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.090
Did you solve the problems in the game?

487
00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.070
I kind of made some progress.

488
00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.970
But about the flying stars, Professor Ye doesn't know much either.

489
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.070
Flying stars?

490
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.230
I think I…

491
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.510
You read it only this morning.

492
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.190
Yeah.

493
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.960
Sha Ruishan gave us this paper.

494
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.800
Do you know who wrote it?

495
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.320
Who?

496
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.550
Yang Dong's mother.

497
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.230
Ye Wenjie.

498
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.940
(Wenjie Ye
Tsinghua University)

499
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.700
(Stellar Structure and Evolution)

500
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.110
Stellar Structure and Evolution.

501
00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.670
Professor Ye recommended this book to me.

502
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:09.710
She said she quoted a lot from this book when writing this paper.

503
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.190
I need to find this book and read it asap.

504
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.710
I'll take this paper with me and do some research.

505
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:16.800
I've got to go.

506
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.360
Alright.

507
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:33.320
Are you more suspicious of Ye Wenjie now?

508
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:42.150
At first I just felt she took Yang Dong's death too calmly.

509
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.230
(OS: Well.)

510
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.110
Her life remained completely unchanged.
(OS: It's time)

511
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.550
(OS: for cartoons.)

512
00:41:52.550 --> 00:42:00.150
She accepted the turkey theory, helped Wang Miao observe cosmic flicker.

513
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.030
She encouraged Wang Miao to follow Copernicus's example.

514
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:09.630
She's also an astrophysicist, who wrote a paper about flying stars.

515
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:14.030
Just now Wang Miao said that in the Red Coast Base,

516
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.130
she loved to see the sun,

517
00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:21.320
but she's got nothing to do with the Frontiers of Science.

518
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.460
It strikes me that she is the biggest questionable point.
